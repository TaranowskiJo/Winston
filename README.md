[3D Asset Pips the Pigeon](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/pips-the-pigeon-quirky-series-178508)

Myself and a group of two others attempted to learn unity basics and create a 3D game with the last week of our coding stack.
Our MVP end of the week was to have these functions in our game:

* User should have basic movement control
* Navigate an obstacle filled environment

The entirety of this project involved:

* Unity Game Engine
* C# Language

Testing and TroubleShooting
</h4>

As with any collaborative process there were disagreements which needed to be resolved for the project to move forward, especially with such a limited time frame.
During this process, designing and defining the user controls was an area in which we brought different perspectives to the table. 
Ultimately, through a handful of user tests we determined the most sensible option was to have the controls limited to essentially only the 'a' and 'd' key.
The alternative was a dynamic control set involving the mouse and traditional 'wasd' for left,down,center,right, in addition to a mouse controlled camera.
However this was scrapped due to being unintuitive and the forward key being redundant in our overall game design. We determined holding down the forwared key in a game in which we never intended you to move backwards through the level was unnecessary and uncomfortable. Also, given how significantly we had to scale down the overall project, it was a similar reasoning for the mouse camera being removed from the project, as we did not want to add extra features that didn't align with the intended gameplay.

The Project
</h4>


The final product was our pigeon flying forward at a constant rate, with our camera following it from a set distance, left/right controls to dodge obstacles that, if hit, would result in collisions.

Lessons Learned
</h4>

This project was rich in new skills for all of us. Along with the time crunch to learn a new program, we had to balance the coordination of schedules, vision, interests, and abilities. Our daily standups were essential to our daily direction, especially in creating a project which got revisioned multiple times throughout the course of a week.
