Planning
</h4>
Myself and a group of two others attempted to learn unity basics and create a 3D game with the last week of our coding stack.
Our MVP end of the week was to have these functions in our game:

* User should have basic movement control
* Navigate an obstacle filled environment

Technologies

The entirety of this project involved:
* Unity Game Engine
* C# Language
